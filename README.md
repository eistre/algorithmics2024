# Algorithmics Group Project 2024

This repository contains the implementation of an efficient travel planning system using graph algorithms.

## Project Overview
A travel route optimization system designed to help travelers plan their journeys efficiently. The project focuses on finding optimal routes between multiple destinations using advanced graph algorithms, considering factors such as distance, time, and cost.

### Core Features
- Route optimization based on multiple criteria (distance, time, cost)
- Custom destination input support
- Flexible route planning with configurable start/end points

## Getting Started
